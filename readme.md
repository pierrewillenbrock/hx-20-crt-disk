This is a companion program for the EPSON HX-20 emulating the Display
Controller and Terminal Floppy(TF-20X) options.

The HX-20 only uses a limited subset of the available commands so the
emulation is incomplete and has been extended in ways that are
compatible with the HX-20 use but incompatible with other commands.
